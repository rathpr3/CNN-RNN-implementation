# CNN-RNN-implementation
 use a stock market price index data to implement the 1D CNN-RNN architecture
 
 We'll try to model this relationship between the news and the stock market price of an index. Our assumption in modelling the stock price in this exercise is that news headlines that run on a particular day affect the opening stock price of an index the very next morning.

The important thing to keep in mind while doing this code,we will focus on the process of extracting textual features using 1D CNN and then feeding them to an RNN.
